        "In the field of DNA sequence analysis, several commonly used mutation models are used to describe the substitution patterns and rates of genetic changes that occur over time. Here are some of the common mutation models:\n",
        "\n",
        "Jukes-Cantor (JC) Model: The Jukes-Cantor model assumes equal probabilities of all four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) and that all substitution rates are equal. It is a simple and commonly used model but assumes a uniform rate of evolution across the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) Model: The Kimura 2-Parameter model introduces a parameter to account for transitions (substitutions between purines A/G or pyrimidines C/T) and transversions (substitutions between purine and pyrimidine). It allows for different rates of transitions and transversions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) Model: The HKY model extends the K2P model by incorporating different base frequencies. It assumes different stationary frequencies for each nucleotide base (A, C, G, T) and allows for different rates of transitions and transversions.\n",
        "\n",
        "General Time Reversible (GTR) Model: The General Time Reversible model is a more complex model that considers different substitution rates for all possible nucleotide changes. It incorporates base frequencies and six distinct substitution rates. GTR is often considered the most realistic mutation model but requires more computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tamura-Nei (TN) Model: The Tamura-Nei model is an extension of the JC model that incorporates variable base frequencies and different substitution rates. It estimates the base frequencies from the data and allows for rate variation among different nucleotide positions."
